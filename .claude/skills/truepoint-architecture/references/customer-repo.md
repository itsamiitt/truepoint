# Customer App — `apps/web` (`@leadwolf/web`)

Serves `app.truepoint.in`. This is the only surface end customers interact with. It is
one app inside the one Bun monorepo (root package `leadwolf`), alongside `apps/admin`,
`apps/auth`, `apps/api`, and `apps/workers`.

---

## Directory Structure

The monorepo root holds all apps and shared packages; this app is `apps/web`.

```

# .github/workflows/ (path-filtered per app)
```

## Feature Module Pattern

Every meaningful product surface lives in `features/`. A feature module owns
everything for that feature — its components, hooks, API calls, types, and tests.
Nothing leaks out except through the feature's `index.ts`.

```
features/
└── contacts/
    ├── index.ts                 # Public API of this feature (re-exports only)
    ├── components/
    │   ├── ContactList.tsx      # List view
    │   ├── ContactCard.tsx      # Individual card
    │   └── ContactSearch.tsx    # Search input + results
    ├── hooks/
    │   ├── useContacts.ts       # Data fetching hook
    │   └── useContactSearch.ts  # Search state
    ├── api/
    │   ├── index.ts             # Re-exports
    │   ├── fetch.ts             # GET /contacts
    │   └── update.ts            # PATCH /contacts/:id
    ├── types/
    │   └── contact.types.ts
    └── __tests__/
        ├── ContactList.test.tsx
        └── useContacts.test.ts
```

A page imports from the feature, not from inside the feature:
```ts
// ✅ correct
import { ContactList } from '@/features/contacts'

// ❌ wrong — reaches inside the feature's internals
import { ContactList } from '@/features/contacts/components/ContactList'
```

---

## What Goes Where

| Code | Location |
|---|---|
| A page for a route | `app/(auth)/[feature-name]/page.tsx` |
| Feature components, hooks, API | `features/[feature-name]/` |
| A component used by 3+ features | `components/` |
| A hook used by 3+ features | `hooks/` |
| A pure helper (formatting, parsing) | `packages/core/src/` |
| A reusable UI primitive (button, input) | `packages/ui/src/` |
| A server action or route handler | `app/api/` |
| An auth check / redirect | `middleware.ts` |
| A request/response type (the API contract) | `packages/types/src/` (shared Zod schemas) |

If you are unsure, ask: does this code know about the customer product? If yes,
it belongs in `features/`. If it is generic enough to work in any Next.js app,
it belongs in a package.

---

## Component Rules

Each component file exports one component. If a component has sub-components
that are only used internally, they live in the same directory as separate files
— not in the same file.

```
ContactCard/
├── index.ts          # re-export
├── ContactCard.tsx   # main component (~60 lines max)
├── ContactAvatar.tsx # sub-component used only here
└── ContactCard.types.ts
```

Props interfaces are defined in the same file as the component unless they are
shared — in that case they move to `[feature].types.ts`.

---

## Hook Rules

Hooks do one thing. If a hook is fetching data AND managing local UI state AND
handling optimistic updates, split it:

```
hooks/
├── useContacts.ts        # fetching + caching only (react-query)
├── useContactForm.ts     # form state only (react-hook-form)
└── useContactOptimistic.ts  # optimistic updates only
```

A hook file should never import from another hook file in the same directory
in a way that creates a chain. If two hooks depend on each other, they belong
in the same feature module with a shared internal utility.

---

## API Call Rules

Never write raw `fetch` or `axios` calls inside components or hooks directly.
All API calls go through a typed client whose payloads are validated against the
shared `@leadwolf/types` Zod schemas, or through a file in the feature's `api/`
folder — never an ad-hoc fetch outside that boundary.

A feature's `api/` folder structure:
```
api/
├── index.ts       # re-exports all functions
├── fetch.ts       # read operations
├── mutate.ts      # write operations (create, update, delete)
└── types.ts       # request/response types for this feature's API
```

Each function in `fetch.ts` and `mutate.ts` has one responsibility: one
endpoint, one return type. Error handling lives in the calling hook, not in
the API file.

---

## Styling

Styling is governed by the **design skill** — this section only states where the
boundary sits, so the two skills agree (the prior Tailwind-vs-inline contradiction
is resolved in favour of the design skill's token-driven approach):

- **Components encapsulate their own styling.** Reach for a `@leadwolf/ui`
  component before a styled `<div>`; the design system carries the look.
- **App-level layout uses inline `style={{ }}` reading `var(--tp-*)` tokens** — not
  Tailwind utility classes in app JSX, and not raw hex/px values. Every colour,
  space, radius, and shadow is a token.
- **No CSS modules** unless a third-party library requires it; `<style>` blocks only
  for the narrow exceptions the design skill lists (`@keyframes`, `@font-face`).
- **Responsive** behaviour follows the design skill's breakpoints and patterns.

Full styling rules, tokens, components, and the permitted exceptions live in the
**truepoint-design** skill — defer to it for anything that renders.
